# donde_coffee
Mission: Donde all the coffee?!

We just want to find good coffee while we travel from Portland, OR to Vancouver, B.C. Is that too much to ask for?

# Tech Stack
### Backend: Python Flask API
### Frontend: React
### Local DB: SQLITE
### External DB: Yelp
### Coffee of choice during this capstone: All of the coffees

# AUTH IS HARD. Here's an absurdly looong list of references (not even all of them) that were used to get us where we are today. 
## Kind of do not recommend using Flask with React. Deployment was V difficult as well.
## Disclosure: Got LOTS of help from senior level mentors to do this.
